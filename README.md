# Tyre-Web-Scraper

'pandas' and 'Selenium' Python extensions are needed, as well as the appropriate driver for the browser in question. The required drivers can be found here: "https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_drivers/". Once downloaded, the driver must be added to the PATH environment.

The web scraper has been configured to work with "www.dexel.co.uk" and requires the user to input their desired width, aspect ratio, and rim size. If the inputted combination of measurements isn't available the user will be asked to select them again from the list.
